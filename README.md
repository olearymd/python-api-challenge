# python-api-challenge

This challenge consisted of two parts.  

In WeatherPy, we used the citypy Python library and OpenWeatherMap API to create scatter plots showcasing the relationship bewween latitude and various factors, including temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed, and we performed linear regression analysis for each.  

In VacationPy, we used the Geofy API and geoViews Python library to create map visualizaitons of cities by various criteria, including humidity, temperature, and windiness, and cloudiness, and we used the Geoapify API to plot hotels in cities which matched our ideal weather conditions.
